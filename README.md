# Crypto-Clustering-
<!-- Module 19 Challenge Crypto Clustering 
Created Repo called Crypto_Clustering-
started by importing pandas, hvplot, sklearn.cluster, sklearn.decomposition, sklearn, preprocessing, warnings and warinings. filter warning, and matplotlib.pyplot. 

started by loading the csv file into the panda dataframe.  
cleaned the data  and prepared the data by adding the coin id column
created the k-values from 1-11 then created an empty list for inertia and ran a loope. 
created a dictionary and put in the df_elbow1. 
ploted the elbow curve which k value = 4
scaled the data and grouped to create a scatter plot  clusters to gether to get the cryptocurrencies. 
 Took the data  and transformed the data using the PCA model. 
Found the K-Mean for the PCA data following similar steps above. 
PCA data K was 4
create a scatter plot using the same steps above. 
took and made elbow curves side beside and then scatter plots. 
Saved the data and uploaded into repo -->
